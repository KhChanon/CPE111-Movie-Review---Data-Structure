Detail        : er along with all his amazing contraptions (I won't complain about Cindy-Lou because in both this and the 2000s version, her character completely changed). There could've been more songs but luckily, they still kept "Welcome Christmas" and "You're a Mean One"(WARNING: remix may take a few days to get used to) which is still respectful to its predecessor.  Overall, despite its flaws, I enjoyed this movie and had fun watching it, Flaws may be noticeable but it all depends on what YOU think.
